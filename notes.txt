The V8 Javascript engine compile your code before it runs it.

Scope: where to look for things (i.e. where to look for variables)

  - Scope is part of the compile-time process

  - If you do variable shadowing, it means u can't access the variable scope above

undefined: is when a variable or function is declared in some scope but there is no assigned value for it.
While undeclared is when a variable or a function is not found in any scope.

Lexical scope always go search for undeclared indetifiers in an upper level scope until it gets to the global scope.
Then it stops.

Named function expression is usally preferred than anonymous function expression. Why?

1- provide a handy way of self-referencing from inside the fucntion itself which is useful in recursion cases.

2- Make your code more debuggable. Since the name of the function will appear in the stack trace. So u can easily locate the
errored function.
